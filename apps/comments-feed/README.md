# Comments Feed

Design and build a comments feed that displays all comments and notifies a user in real-time when new comments are added.

**Format**: Take home

**Time**: n/a

## Specifications

Here is the data schema for a Comment:

- id: INTEGER
- created: DATETIME
- name: TEXT
- message: TEXT

Here are the API endpoints:

- Create a comment: /create-comment (POST)
- Retrieve all comments: /get-comments (GET)
- Retrieve a comment: /get-comment (GET)
- Delete all comments: /delete-comments (DELETE)

## Setup

The commenting API described above was provided by the interviewer. In this example I have recreated a basic version of it using Supabase. Next.js was not required. Any front-end framework was allowed.

```
create table comments (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  message text not null,
  created timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);
```

Create the following in a `.env.local` file in the app's root folder.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
SUPABASE_PROJECT=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```
